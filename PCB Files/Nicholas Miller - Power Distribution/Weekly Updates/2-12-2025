Tasks Completed This Week
  - Presented team progress at TPEC
  - Completed soldering of buck converter and tested the output voltage against a range of input voltages
  - Debugged buck converter to solve issues and ensure preparation for integration

Current Problems
  - Buck converter is outputting a steady output voltage of 2.65V, less than the anticipated 3.3V. (Possible soldering issues with ADP1853 or MOSFET M2 on PCB)

Tasks To Be Achieved Until The Next Week
  - Correct buck converter issues
  - Manufacture multiples of the buck converter to be implemented in the system
