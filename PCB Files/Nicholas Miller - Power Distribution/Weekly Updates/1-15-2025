Tasks Completed This Week
  - Over the winter break/start of this week I spent roughly 36 hours correcting issues with my subsystem that were noted at the end of 403. Since then I have redesigned both the Buck Converter and the Inverter and reordered parts to successfully build operating parts. Additionally I have also been contributing to our Implementation checklist and narrowing down our idea for implementing and presenting

Current Problems
  - None

Tasks To Be Achieved Until The Next Week
  - Successfully solder all components onto the redesigned PCB boards
  - Ensure complete functionality with both Buck Converter and Inverter
  - Begin designing covers for Buck Converter and Inverter
  - Begin subsystem implementation
