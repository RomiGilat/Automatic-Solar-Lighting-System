After designing and manufacturing the SPI Controlled Relay Driver, testing was conducted by implementing the code through the ESP32 and manually triggering the sensors to achieve a response from the SPI Controlled Relay Driver. The SPI Controlled Relay Driver was then integrated with the Modified Sine Wave Inverter and the sensors were triggered again so that we could observe the relay switches being activated.
