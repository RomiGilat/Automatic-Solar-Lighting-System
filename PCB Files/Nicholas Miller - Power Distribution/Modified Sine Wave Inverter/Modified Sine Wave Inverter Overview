#Modified Sine Wave Inverter

The Modified Sine Wave Inverter makes up another 1/3 of the power distribution subsystem. The Modified Sine Wave Inverter uses a 555 timer and a 4017 decade counter to generate a pulsed sine wave that is fed into a pair of MOSFETS. This inverter also features a relay switch that is controlled by the ESP32 through the SPI Controlled Relay Driver. The inverter is connected to the battery at all times and is triggered by user input or the activation of one of the two sensors. The Modified Sine Wave Inverter is connected to a 12-0-12 transformer by reverse connection; the Modified Sine Wave Inverter has three outputs (positive, neutral, and negative) that are fed into the 12-0-12 transformer and steps up the voltage to be approximately 220VAC for the lights to use.
