Buck Converter
The Buck Converter comprises 50% of the power distribution subsystem. The Buck Converter that was designed is based around an ADP1853 Buck Controller used to regulate an output voltage of 3.3V utilized for the MCU subsystem and sensors. This converter is capable of taking in a voltage ranging from 10V to 15V from the battery and maintaining a steady voltage output of 3.3V. In addition to maintaining a voltage output of 3.3V, the converter will be maintaining a steady output current of 500mA which differs from the batteries 5A current output. By stepping down the voltage and current from the battery source, the Buck Converter ensures that the power from the battery is usable by the MCU and sensors.
